Frequency Counter

Use Multithreading to count the word frequency of a text file.

To try out the program:
Open your CMD, type in the command <make run RUNOPTIONS="WarAndPeace.txt 4>. You can replace the number

The program will output the ten most frequently appeared length of six or more words in a 
descending order.
